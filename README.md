# Banker-Algorithm
This repository contains an implementation of the Banker's algorithm in Python. The Banker's algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems. It ensures that resource requests from processes can be granted without resulting in a deadlock.


The code provides a `BankerAlgorithm` class that encapsulates the logic of the algorithm. It allows you to initialize the current resource allocation, maximum resource demand, and available resources. You can then use the `request_resources` method to request resources for a specific process and the `release_resources` method to release previously allocated resources.

The `is_safe_state` method checks if the current resource allocation state is safe, indicating whether there exists a sequence of resource allocations that can avoid deadlock.

The example code included in the repository demonstrates how to use the `BankerAlgorithm` class. It shows an example of a resource request and a resource release, along with checking the current state for safety.

Feel free to explore the code, use it as a reference, or integrate it into your own projects.

Usage:
1. Initialize the `BankerAlgorithm` object with the allocated, maximum demand, and available resources.
2. Use the `request_resources` method to request resources for a process.
3. Use the `release_resources` method to release previously allocated resources.
4. Check the current state for safety using the `is_safe_state` method.

Please note that this implementation is a simplified version and may not cover all possible scenarios or error handling. Ensure that the inputs provided are correct and consistent before using the algorithm.

Contributions and improvements to the code are welcome. If you find any issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
